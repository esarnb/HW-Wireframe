# HW-Wireframe

HW-Wireframe is a basic frame for making a sectioned website, with a header space, nav, footer, and split content in the middle. 

## Getting Started

Opening the index.html in your browser will show the wireframe, using the styles from the stylesheet.

### Prerequisites

Once you put your files in a folder, right click the index.html and open it with your preferred browser.
```

## Deployment

If you would like to host this wireframe, make sure you have setup your system with a proper website host, for example apache or nginx.

Then put the folder within your html directory, or the files themselves if you would like to make it the homepage.
